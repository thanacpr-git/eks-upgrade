# Start the Workshop

Before proceeding with Planning and Upgrade , please follow workshop set up instruction from <strong>Option 1 (Preferred): Running the workshop using Workshop Studio for AWS events</strong> in https://catalog.workshops.aws/eks-immersionday/en-US/introduction. Next set up a workload by following below steps:

### [1] Check Running EKS version 
- Verify EKS cluster in version 1.24 from console https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=us-east-1#/clusters
  
    ![Alt text](/assets/00_start_eks_version.png "a title")

### [2] Deploy the microservices application using Helm

- From Cloud 9 Console , Install helm using step below :

    ```
    cd ~/environment/eks-app-mesh-polyglot-demo
    helm install workshop ~/environment/eks-app-mesh-polyglot-demo/workshop/helm-chart/
    ```
    **Output**
    ```
    NAME: workshop
    LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Sep 11 00:56:04 2023
    NAMESPACE: default
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    NOTES:
    ```


- Get the application URL by running these commands:

    ```
    export LB_NAME=$(kubectl get svc --namespace workshop frontend -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}")
    
    echo http://$LB_NAME:80
    ```


    **NOTE:** The command may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer to be available. You can monitor the status of LoadBalancer by using command
    
    ```
    kubectl get --namespace workshop svc -w frontend
    ```

### [3] Deploy test application on EKS Cluster

- Deploy Cronjob

    ```
    cd ~/environment 
    cat << EoF > ~/environment/my-cj.yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
    kind: CronJob

      name: hello
    spec:
      schedule: "* * * * *"
      jobTemplate:
        spec:

                command:
                - /bin/sh
                - -c
                - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
              restartPolicy: OnFailure
    EoF
    kubectl apply -f ~/environment/my-cj.yaml
    ```
    Dismiss the output below
    ```
    Warning: batch/v1beta1 CronJob is deprecated in v1.21+, unavailable in v1.25+; use batch/v1 CronJob

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
    ```
    
    Verify Status the status of the metrics-server APIService (This can take few minutes).

    ```
    kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io -o json | jq '.status'
    ```
    Output
    ```
    {
    "conditions": [
        {

    ```


- Deploy Horizontal Pod Autoscaler :

    ```
    cd ~/environment 
    cat << EoF > ${HOME}/environment/hpa_proddetail.yaml

    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
    metadata:
      name: proddetail
      namespace: workshop
    spec:
      maxReplicas: 3

    EoF
    kubectl apply -f ~/environment/hpa_proddetail.yaml
    ```    
    Output
    ```
    Warning: autoscaling/v2beta1 HorizontalPodAutoscaler is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.25+; use autoscaling/v2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler
    horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/proddetail created
    ```
    Verify if HPA is set up properly
    ```
    kubectl get hpa proddetail -n workshop
    ```
    Output
    ```
    NAME         REFERENCE               TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
